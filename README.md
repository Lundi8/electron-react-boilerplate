# Electron boilerplate

## Descriptions

- Based on repository forked from https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate
- Use electron, electron-builder, react, redux, react-router, material-ui, styled jsx, gsap and @directus/sdk-js.
- For more informations go to the original [README](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)
- !important! if you don't have a second screen in dev mode, you have to set BrowserWindow.x to 0 in ./app/main.dev.js. Otherwise you should not see the electron-app pop-up

## Basic scripts

- dev : `yarn dev`
- prod : `yarn start`
- prod build : `yarn package-win`
